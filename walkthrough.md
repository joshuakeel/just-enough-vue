1. Create some chat data and display some chat messages:

   ```
   [
   { user: "Josh", message: "Hello, world! How are you today?" },
   {
   user: "Frank",
   message:
   "Hi Josh, do you have a minute? I have some questions about the TPS reports you submitted.",
   },
   ]
   ```

2. Add an input field and a button to send new messages.
3. Bind the input to a model, and bind the button's click event to a method.
4. Add currentUser field to display the correct user when we send a message.
